# **Heart Disease Detection Introduction**

This dataset contains information based on attributes of a patients with concern of  possible heart disease. The goal is to use the data to predict if a person has a heart disease or not as well as gaining various insights to better understand heart disease.

The dataset is provided complimentary by UGI and can be found [here](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Heart+Disease). 


The dataset was created by: -
1. Hungarian Institute of Cardiology. Budapest: Andras Janosi, M.D.
2. University Hospital, Zurich, Switzerland: William Steinbrunn, M.D.
3. University Hospital, Basel, Switzerland: Matthias Pfisterer, M.D.
4. V.A. Medical Center, Long Beach and Cleveland Clinic Foundation: Robert Detrano, M.D., Ph.D.

**The dataset contains 14 columns:**

**age:** age in years

**sex:** (1 = male; 0 = female)

**cp:** chest pain type (0=asymptomatic, 1=atypical angina, 2=non-anginal pain, 3=typical angina)

**trestbps:** resting blood pressure (in mm Hg on admission to the hospital)

**chol:** serum cholesterol in mg/dl

**fbs:** (fasting blood sugar > 120 mg/dl) (1 = true; 0 = false)

**restecg:** resting electrocardiographic results (0=showing probable or definite left ventricular hypertrophy by Estes’ criteria, 1= normal, 2= having ST-T wave abnormality (T wave inversions and/or ST elevation or depression of > 0.05 mV)

**thalach:** maximum heart rate achieved during a stress test

**exang:** exercise induced angina (1 = yes; 0 = no)

**oldpeak:** ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest (‘ST’ relates to positions on the ECG plot)

**slope:** the slope of the peak exercise ST segment (0= downsloping, 1=flat, 2=upsloping)

**ca:** number of major vessels (0-3) colored by fluoroscopy

**thal:** 3 = normal; 6 = fixed defect; 7 = reversible defect

**target:** 1 (has heart disease) or 0 (does not have heart disease)
